That means: \n","1. Loading and exploring the data\n","2. Running initial models \n","## Features of this Notebook \n","1. Easy to access the data \n","2. Has tesla t4 GPU which is a top tier GPU with 16gb memory\n","3. Has 500 gb local storage \n","4. It now supports a file system with a text editor (similar to jupyter lab) \n","5. Sadly, it only has 12 gb of system memory\n","## Connecting it to google drive: \n","1. Make sure you are working on the google account given to you by us: the @picampus-school.com account. \n","2. First, you need to add the proejct folder we shared with you to my drive. \n","3. then you can run the notebook below"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fwHRMaid9hie","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f204d84d-6d06-4a5c-fa36-b180c4fc68f4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1572347480168,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":67499,"user":{"displayName":"Jamila Mifdal","photoUrl":"","userId":"05092913479652264754"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":147}},"source":["import sys\n","from google.colab import drive\n","print(\"hello world\")\n","#remember to select your @picampus- school account here for mounting\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["hello world\n","Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=947318989803-6bn6qk8qdgf4n4g3pfee6491hc0brc4i.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&scope=email%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdocs.test%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.photos.readonly%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fpeopleapi.readonly&response_type=code\n","\n","Enter your authorization code:\n","··········\n","Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"o2eoD6rD9lDr","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import sys,os\n","PROJECT_NAME=\"project_template\"\n","\n","#changing directory to google colab directory #\n","#os.chdir(f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github#\")\n","os.chdir(f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github\")\n","\n","#this is to be able to load the data from the shared stakeholder folder: Don't write \n","#anything there. \n","STAKEHOLDER_DATA_PATH=f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/shared_with_stakeholder/data/\""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"L7MmFVqADP2S","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
